    "nheritance in Python is a fundamental concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (called a child or subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a parent or superclass). The child class can then extend or modify the behavior of the parent class while inheriting its functionality. Inheritance promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchies of classes with shared characteristics and behaviors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Base Class and Derived Class: Inheritance involves defining a base class (or superclass) and creating one or more derived classes (or subclasses) that inherit from the base class. The derived class inherits all the attributes and methods of the base class.\n",

    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing subclasses to inherit existing functionality from their parent classes. This reduces code duplication and makes it easier to maintain and extend the codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extensibility: Subclasses can extend or modify the behavior of their parent classes by adding new attributes or methods, overriding existing methods, or providing additional functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical Structure: Inheritance facilitates the creation of hierarchical class structures, where classes are organized in a parent-child relationship based on their similarities and differences. This hierarchical structure helps in modeling real-world entities more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common parent class. This enables more flexible and modular code by allowing functions and methods to operate on objects of different types through a common interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Inheritance is closely related to encapsulation, another key principle of OOP. Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behavior) within a class, and inheritance allows subclasses to access and manipulate this encapsulated data and behavior."

    "Method overriding is a concept in inheritance where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the inherited method without modifying the superclass's implementation. Method overriding is achieved by defining a method in the subclass with the same name, parameters, and return type as the method in the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how method overriding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object of the subclass, the Python interpreter first looks for that method in the subclass.\n",
    "If the method is found in the subclass, the subclass's implementation is executed.\n",
    "If the method is not found in the subclass, the Python interpreter looks for it in the superclass and executes the superclass's implementation.\n",
    "Method overriding is significant because it allows for polymorphic behavior, where objects of different subclasses can respond to the same method call differently based on their specific implementations."

    "In Python, the super() function is used in inheritance to call methods and access attributes of the parent class (superclass) from a child class (subclass). It provides a way to delegate method calls to the parent class, allowing for code reuse and enabling cooperative multiple inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The super() function is particularly useful in situations where you want to invoke the parent class's method within the overridden method of the child class, ensuring that both the child and parent class implementations are executed. This promotes maintainability and facilitates overriding methods in subclasses while retaining the behavior of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of when and why super() is used in Python inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling Parent Class Constructors: In a child class's constructor, super().__init__() is commonly used to call the constructor of the parent class. This ensures that the initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed before the child class's initialization logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoking Parent Class Methods: Inside a method of the child class, super().method_name() is used to call the corresponding method of the parent class. This allows the child class to extend or modify the behavior of the parent class method while still invoking the parent class's implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cooperative Multiple Inheritance: When dealing with multiple inheritance, super() helps resolve method resolution order (MRO) conflicts by providing a consistent way to call methods of the parent classes."
